Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide? 

"""numberToString(double d, int base) {
        if (d != d)
            return "NaN";
        if (d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)
            return "Infinity";
        if (d == Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)
            return "-Infinity";
        if (d == 0.0)

A: This code decides how to convert a double-precision floating-point number into its string representation, handling special cases like NaN, positive and negative infinity, and zero, and formatting the number according to a specified base (from 2 to 36). If the base is not 10, it uses a specific method for conversion; if the base is 10, it formats the number in standard decimal notation. If the base is outside the allowed range, it throws an error.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a string representation of the input double value, formatted according to the specified base. For special values, it returns "NaN" for not-a-number, "Infinity" for positive infinity, "-Infinity" for negative infinity, and "0" for zero. For other numbers, it returns their string representation in the given base (between 2 and 36), or in standard decimal notation if the base is 10. If the base is invalid, it throws a runtime error instead of returning a value.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double value d and the integer base. The value of d determines if the result will be "NaN", "Infinity", "-Infinity", "0", or a numeric string, while the value of base determines the numeral system used for the conversion and whether an error is thrown for invalid bases.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
**Inputs:**  
- **d (double):**  
  - *Data type:* double (floating-point number)  
  - *Possible values:* Any valid Java double value, including regular numbers (positive, negative, fractional), special values like NaN (Not a Number), Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, and zero (0.0 or -0.0).

- **base (int):**  
  - *Data type:* int (integer)  
  - *Possible values:* Any integer, but only values from 2 to 36 (inclusive) are valid for conversion. Values outside this range will cause the function to throw a runtime error.

**Output:**  
- *Data type:* String  
- *Possible values:*  
  - "NaN" if d is not a number  
  - "Infinity" if d is positive infinity  
  - "-Infinity" if d is negative infinity  
  - "0" if d is zero  
  - A string representation of d in the specified base (for bases 2–36, except 10 uses a different formatting method)  
  - For invalid base values (less than 2 or greater than 36), the function does not return a value but throws a runtime error.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are:

- For d (double):  
  - NaN (Not a Number)
  - Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
  - Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
  - 0.0 (including -0.0, since both are treated as zero in this context)
  - Any other finite double value (positive or negative)

- For base (int):  
  - Valid values: integers from 2 to 36 (inclusive)
  - Invalid values: integers less than 2 or greater than 36 (these cause a runtime error)

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

{
    "Conditions": {
        "d": {
            "Type": "boolean"

    "DecisionRules": [

        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base == 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: The table is complete. For every possible combination of inputs for d and base, there is an applicable rule:

- If d is NaN, the first rule applies.
- If d is positive infinity, the second rule applies.
- If d is negative infinity, the third rule applies.
- If d is zero, the fourth rule applies.
- For all other values of d, the next rules consider the value of base:
    - If base is less than 2 or greater than 36, the fifth rule applies.
    - If base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive) and not equal to 10, the sixth rule applies.
    - If base is exactly 10, the seventh rule applies.

There is no combination of d and base for which none of the rules would apply.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: The inputs to the decision are the variables d and base.
