Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer.

A: This code decides the `double` floating-point value represented by a segment of an input string when interpreted as a number in a specified numerical base.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a `double` value, which is either the numerical representation of the string segment in the given radix, or `NaN` (Not a Number) if the segment cannot be parsed or represents a value that cannot be accurately represented.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the input string `s`, the starting index `start` within the string, and the numerical base `radix`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:
For the inputs:
1.  `s`:
    *   Data Type: `String`
    *   Possible Values: Any valid Java string. This includes empty strings, strings containing digits (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), or any other characters. The function will attempt to parse a segment of this string.
2.  `start`:
    *   Data Type: `int`
    *   Possible Values: Non-negative integers, typically ranging from `0` up to `s.length()`. It indicates the starting position in the string `s` from where parsing should begin.
3.  `radix`:
    *   Data Type: `int`
    *   Possible Values: Integers, typically representing a numerical base from 2 to 36. The code specifically handles `radix < 10`, `radix > 10`, `radix == 10`, and power-of-two radices (2, 4, 8, 16, 32) for precision adjustments.

For the output:
1.  Return value:
    *   Data Type: `double`
    *   Possible Values:
        *   A finite `double` value representing the numerical interpretation of the specified substring in the given `radix`.
        *   `Double.NaN` (Not a Number) if the substring starting at `start` is empty, contains characters invalid for the specified `radix` before any valid digits are found, or if an internal `NumberFormatException` occurs.
        *   The value can also be a `double` that has undergone precision adjustments if it's very large (around or exceeding 2^53) and the radix is 10 or a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32).

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values for key numerical variables that influence the decision logic within the provided code are as follows:
For the `radix` variable, relevant values include those less than 10 (which adjust `digitMax`), values greater than 10 (which adjust `lowerCaseBound` and `upperCaseBound`), the specific value 10, and the specific power-of-two values 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. These specific radices trigger specialized precision handling logic if the parsed number is very large.
For the `start` index, its value is relevant in relation to `len` (the string length) and `end` (the parsing end index). For example, if `start` is equal to `len` before parsing, or if `start` becomes equal to `end` after the main parsing loop (meaning no valid digits were found), the function may return `NaN`.
The `len` variable, representing the input string's length, is relevant as it defines the upper boundary for the main parsing loop (`end < len`).
The `end` index is primarily relevant through its comparison with `start` (the condition `start == end` is checked to determine if any digits were parsed) and `len` (as the loop counter).
For the `sum` variable, a critical value is the threshold `9007199254740992.0` (equivalent to 2^53). If `sum` reaches or exceeds this value, special precision handling is invoked for radix 10 or power-of-two radices. Other relevant values for `sum` include its initial value of `0.0` and the value `1.0` to which it can be set during the bit-processing logic for large power-of-two radix numbers.
The `newDigit` variable can take integer values from `0` up to `radix - 1`, representing the numerical value of a parsed character.
Within the specialized precision handling logic for large numbers in power-of-two radices:
The `state` variable uses the specific integer constant values `0` (SKIP_LEADING_ZEROS), `1` (FIRST_EXACT_53_BITS), `2` (AFTER_BIT_53), `3` (ZEROS_AFTER_54), and `4` (MIXED_AFTER_54) to control the parsing flow.
The `exactBitsLimit` variable is initialized to `53`, and its value reaching `0` is a relevant event that triggers a state transition.
The `bitShiftInChar` variable is initialized with the `radix` value when a new character's bits are first processed, and the value `1` is significant, as `bitShiftInChar == 1` indicates that all bits from the current `digit` have been processed and a new character should be fetched.
The `digit` variable holds the integer value (typically `0` to `35`) of the character currently being processed for its bits.
The `factor` variable is initialized to `0.0`, then set to `2.0`, and is subsequently multiplied by `2.0` in certain states; its final value is used to scale the `sum`.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. Each possible execution path of the Java code that leads to a decision outcome (a return value) is covered by a rule in the DMN table. The conditions in the DMN table are based on the direct conditional checks in the source code:
1.  Whether `start == end`.
2.  If not, whether `sum >= 9007199254740992.0`.
3.  If `sum` is greater than or equal to the threshold, then checks on `radix`:
    *   Whether `radix == 10`.
        *   If so, the outcome of the `Double.valueOf()` call (success or `NumberFormatException`).
    *   Else, whether `radix` is one of the power-of-two values (2, 4, 8, 16, 32).
    *   Else (other radix values).

The DMN rules systematically cover all combinations of these conditions, ensuring that for any set of input values (`s`, `start`, `radix`) which determine the intermediate states (`end`, `sum`, and the outcome of `Double.valueOf`), one rule will be applicable. The conditions within the rules are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for the decision logic presented in the code.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: According to the table, the inputs to the decision are the conditions named "start, end", "sum", "radix", and "s, start, end for Double.valueOf".
