Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks.

A: This code decides how to convert a double-precision floating-point number to its string representation in a specified base, handling special numeric values and validating the base.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a string representation of the input double-precision floating-point number.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double-precision floating-point number `d` and the integer `base`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The input variable `d` has a data type of `double`. Its possible values encompass all valid double-precision floating-point numbers, including special values like `NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, zero (`0.0`), and any other finite positive or negative number. The input variable `base` has a data type of `int`. While it can technically be any integer, the function requires this value to be between 2 and 36, inclusive, for a successful number-to-string conversion; values outside this range cause a runtime error. The output of the function is a `String`. This output string will be `"NaN"` if `d` is `NaN`, `"Infinity"` if `d` is `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, or `"-Infinity"` if `d` is `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. If `d` is `0.0`, the output string is `"0"`. For other finite, non-zero values of `d` and a valid `base` (an integer from 2 to 36), the output is a string representation of `d` in that `base`; this is a standard decimal string if `base` is 10, or a string in the specified `base` (such as binary or hexadecimal) if `base` is different from 10.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: For the double variable `d`, the relevant values are `NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `0.0`, and any other finite non-zero number. For the integer variable `base`, the relevant values are those less than 2, those greater than 36, the specific value 10, and values between 2 and 36 (inclusive) that are not 10.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, this table is complete. For any possible combination of input values for `d` (a double) and `base` (an integer), one of the rules will be applicable.

The conditions for `d` are structured to cover all possibilities:
1.  `d != d` (which is true if `d` is `NaN`). If this is true, Rule 1 applies. The `base` condition is "-", meaning it's irrelevant.
2.  If `d` is not `NaN` (`!(d != d)`), then `d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. If true, Rule 2 applies. `base` is irrelevant.
3.  If `d` is not `NaN` and not `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, then `d == Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. If true, Rule 3 applies. `base` is irrelevant.
4.  If `d` is not `NaN`, not `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, and not `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, then `d == 0.0`. If true, Rule 4 applies. `base` is irrelevant.
5.  If `d` is not `NaN`, not `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, not `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, and not `0.0` (i.e., `d` is any other finite, non-zero number), then one of Rules 5, 6, or 7 will apply based on the value of `base`.

For this fifth case (where `d` is a finite, non-zero number), the conditions on `base` are:
*   Rule 5: `(base < 2) || (base > 36)` (i.e., `base` is outside the valid range [2, 36]).
*   Rule 6: `!((base < 2) || (base > 36)) && base != 10` (i.e., `base` is within the valid range [2, 36] AND `base` is not 10).
*   Rule 7: `!((base < 2) || (base > 36)) && !(base != 10)` (i.e., `base` is within the valid range [2, 36] AND `base` is 10).

These three conditions for `base` are mutually exclusive and cover all possible integer values for `base` when `d` is a finite, non-zero number.
Therefore, for any combination of `d` and `base`, exactly one rule in the decision table will be satisfied.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: The inputs to the decision are `d` and `base`.
