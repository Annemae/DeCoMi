Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides the string representation of a double-precision floating-point number, handling special cases like NaN, Infinity, and zero, and converting the number to a string in a specified numerical base (between 2 and 36 inclusive).

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a string representation of the input double `d`.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double-precision floating-point number `d` and the integer `base`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The first input variable, `d`, has a data type of `double`. Its possible values include any standard double-precision floating-point numbers, such as -1.5, 0.0, or 42.7, as well as special floating-point values like `NaN` (Not a Number), `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, and `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. The second input variable, `base`, has a data type of `int`. While it can be any integer, the function is designed to work with `base` values from 2 to 36, inclusive; values outside this range will trigger a runtime error. The output of the function is a `String`. Possible string values include `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"`, and `"0"` for the corresponding special cases or value of `d`. For other finite values of `d` and a valid `base`, the output is a string representing the number `d` converted to that numerical base, such as a decimal string if `base` is 10, or a hexadecimal string if `base` is 16.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: For the numerical variable `d`, the relevant values are the special floating-point constants `NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, and the value `0.0`. Additionally, all other finite double values (e.g., 1.0, -3.14) form a distinct category that is handled by the number-to-string conversion logic. For the numerical variable `base`, relevant values include integers less than 2 (e.g., 1, 0) and integers greater than 36 (e.g., 37, 100), as these define the boundaries for invalid base values leading to a runtime error. The specific integer value 10 is also relevant as it dictates a particular conversion method. Finally, integers from 2 to 36, inclusive, but not equal to 10 (e.g., 2, 8, 16, 32), form another category of relevant values for the base, utilizing a different conversion method.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. The decision rules are structured in a way that covers all possible combinations of input values for `d` and `base`.

The conditions for the variable `d` are evaluated sequentially:
1.  `d != d` (covers NaN).
2.  If not NaN, `d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` (covers positive infinity).
3.  If not NaN and not positive infinity, `d == Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` (covers negative infinity).
4.  If not NaN, not positive infinity, and not negative infinity, `d == 0.0` (covers zero).
5.  If none of the above, `d` is a finite, non-zero number. This case is covered by the `d` condition `!(d != d) && !(d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) && !(d == Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) && !(d == 0.0)` used in rules 5, 6, and 7.

These five scenarios for `d` are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, covering all possible values of a `double`.

For the fifth scenario (where `d` is a finite, non-zero number), the conditions for the variable `base` are then evaluated:
1.  `(base < 2) || (base > 36)` (invalid base).
2.  If the base is not invalid, `base != 10` (valid base, not equal to 10).
3.  If the base is not invalid and not `!= 10` (i.e., `base == 10`).

These three scenarios for `base` (given `d` is finite and non-zero) are also mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for all integer values of `base`.

Since the rules effectively mirror a nested if-else-if structure that covers all possibilities for `d`, and within the final `else` block for `d`, all possibilities for `base`, every possible pair of inputs (`d`, `base`) will match exactly one rule in the decision table. Therefore, there is an applicable rule for every set of inputs, and the table is complete.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: According to the table, the inputs to the decision are `d` and `base`.
