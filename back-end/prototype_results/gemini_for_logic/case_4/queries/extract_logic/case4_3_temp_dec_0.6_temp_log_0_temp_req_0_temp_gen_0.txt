Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides the string representation of a double-precision floating-point number, considering special values like NaN and Infinity, and a specified numeric base for the conversion.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a string.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double-precision floating-point number `d` and the integer `base`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:
Input `d`:
*   Data Type: `double` (double-precision floating-point number).
*   Possible Values: Any valid double value, including special values like `NaN` (Not a Number), `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, zero (`0.0`), and any other finite positive or negative floating-point number.

Input `base`:
*   Data Type: `int` (integer).
*   Possible Values: Any integer. However, the function's logic specifically handles values between 2 and 36 (inclusive) for conversion. If `base` is less than 2 or greater than 36, the function throws a runtime error.

Output (Return Value):
*   Data Type: `String`.
*   Possible Values:
    *   `"NaN"` if the input `d` is `NaN`.
    *   `"Infinity"` if the input `d` is `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
    *   `"-Infinity"` if the input `d` is `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
    *   `"0"` if the input `d` is `0.0`.
    *   A string representation of the number `d` in the specified `base` (if `base` is valid, i.e., between 2 and 36 inclusive, and `d` is a finite non-zero number).
    *   Note: If `base` is outside the range [2, 36], the function throws a `RuntimeException` instead of returning a string.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are as follows:

For the input variable `d` (double):
*   The special floating-point value `NaN` (Not a Number), as it is explicitly checked and results in the string "NaN".
*   The special floating-point value `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, as it is explicitly checked and results in the string "Infinity".
*   The special floating-point value `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, as it is explicitly checked and results in the string "-Infinity".
*   The floating-point value `0.0`, as it is explicitly checked and results in the string "0".
*   Other finite, non-zero double values (both positive and negative), as these values proceed to the base-dependent conversion logic.

For the input variable `base` (int):
*   Integer values less than 2 (e.g., 1, 0, -1), as these values cause the function to throw a runtime error.
*   Integer values greater than 36 (e.g., 37, 40, 100), as these values also cause the function to throw a runtime error.
*   The integer value `10`, which is a valid base and uses a specific conversion method (`DToA.JS_dtostr`) if `d` is a finite, non-zero number.
*   Integer values in the range [2, 9] inclusive, which are valid bases and use the `DToA.JS_dtobasestr` conversion method if `d` is a finite, non-zero number.
*   Integer values in the range [11, 36] inclusive, which are also valid bases and use the `DToA.JS_dtobasestr` conversion method if `d` is a finite, non-zero number.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. The conditions for the input variable `d` across rules 1, 2, 3, 4, and the shared condition for rules 5, 6, 7 (`(d == d) && (d != Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) && (d != Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) && (d != 0.0)`) are mutually exclusive and collectively cover all possible values of a double-precision floating-point number. If `d` is NaN, positive infinity, negative infinity, or zero, rules 1, 2, 3, or 4 apply respectively, regardless of the `base` value (as indicated by `base: "-"`). If `d` is a finite, non-zero number, then one of rules 5, 6, or 7 will apply based on the value of `base`. The conditions for `base` in these three rules (`(base < 2) || (base > 36)`, `!((base < 2) || (base > 36)) && (base != 10)`, and `!((base < 2) || (base > 36)) && !(base != 10)`) are also mutually exclusive and cover all possible integer values for `base`. Therefore, for any given set of inputs for `d` and `base`, exactly one rule in the decision table will be applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: The inputs to the decision are `d` and `base`.
