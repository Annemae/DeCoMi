Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide? 

"""checkArgument(boolean expression) {
    if (!expression) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
}""" 

A: This code decides whether a given boolean expression is true. If the expression is false, it throws an IllegalArgumentException; otherwise, it does nothing and allows the program to continue.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function does not return any value; it has a void return type. If the boolean expression is true, the function completes normally without returning anything. If the expression is false, it throws an IllegalArgumentException and does not return.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The only variable that influences this decision is the boolean parameter named expression. Its value determines whether the function completes normally or throws an exception.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
Input:  
- Name: expression  
- Data type: boolean  
- Possible values: true or false  

Output:  
- The function has a void return type, so it does not return any value.  
- However, as a side effect, it may throw an exception:  
  - Exception type: IllegalArgumentException  
  - Thrown when the input (expression) is false  
  - Not thrown when the input (expression) is true

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: There are no numerical variables in this function. The only input is a boolean variable named expression, which can only take the values true or false. Therefore, there are no relevant values for numerical variables in this context.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

{
    "Conditions" : {
        "expression" : {
            "Type" : "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions" : {
        "checkArgument(boolean expression)" : {
            "Type" : "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules" : [
        {
            "expression" : "!expression",
            "checkArgument(boolean expression)" : "throw new IllegalArgumentException();"
        },
        {
            "expression" : "expression",
            "checkArgument(boolean expression)" : null
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, this table is complete. The only input variable is expression, which is boolean and can be either true or false. The two rules cover both possible values: one for expression being false ("!expression") and one for expression being true ("expression"). There is no possible input for which a rule would not be applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: The input to the decision is the boolean variable expression.
