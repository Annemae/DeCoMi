Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide? 

"""numberToString(double d, int base) {
        if (d != d)
            return "NaN";
        if (d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)
            return "Infinity";
        if (d == Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)
            return "-Infinity";
        if (d == 0.0)

A: This code decides how to convert a double-precision floating-point number into its string representation, handling special cases such as NaN, positive/negative infinity, and zero. It also decides how to format the number based on the specified base (from 2 to 36), using different logic for decimal (base 10) and non-decimal bases. If the base is not within the allowed range, it throws an error.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a string representation of the input double value according to the specified base. For NaN, it returns "NaN"; for positive infinity, "Infinity"; for negative infinity, "-Infinity"; and for zero, "0". For other values, it returns the appropriate string representation of the number in the given base (using DToA.JS_dtobasestr for bases other than 10, and DToA.JS_dtostr for base 10). If the base is not between 2 and 36 inclusive, it throws a runtime error.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double d (the number to be converted) and the integer base (the radix to use for conversion). The values of d and base determine the output string, including handling of special cases and choice of conversion method.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
- **Input:**
  - `d` (double): This is a double-precision floating-point number. It can take any value representable by a Java `double`, including normal numbers, positive or negative zero, positive or negative infinity, and NaN (not-a-number).
  - `base` (int): This is an integer representing the radix (base) for string conversion. Valid values are integers from 2 to 36 inclusive. If the value is outside this range, the function will throw a runtime error.

- **Output:**
  - The return value is a `String`. Possible values include:
    - Literal strings: `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"`, `"0"`.
    - A numeric string representation of `d` in the specified base (for example, `"10"`, `"101.1"`, `"ff"`, depending on both `d` and `base`). The exact format depends on the implementation of `DToA.JS_dtobasestr` (for non-decimal bases) or `DToA.JS_dtostr` (for decimal/base 10).
    - No output (the function throws an exception) if the base is not between 2 and 36 inclusive.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are as follows:

- For `d` (the double input):
  - `NaN` (not-a-number)
  - `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`
  - `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`
  - `0.0` (positive or negative zero)
  - Any other finite double-precision value (positive or negative)

- For `base` (the radix for conversion):
  - Any integer between 2 and 36 inclusive, which are valid values for conversion
  - Values less than 2 or greater than 36 are also relevant because they cause the function to throw a runtime error

The function branches its logic and output based on these relevant values.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

{
    "Conditions" : {
        "d" : {
            "Type" : "boolean"
        },
        "base" : {
            "Type" : "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions" : {
        "numberToString(double d, int base)" : {
            "Type" : "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules" : [
        {
            "d" : "d != d",
            "base" : "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return \"NaN\";"

        },
        {
            "d" : "d == 0.0",
            "base" : "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return \"0\";"
        },
        {
            "d" : "-",
            "base" : "(base < 2) || (base > 36)",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "throw Context.reportRuntimeError1(\"msg.bad.radix\", Integer.toString(base));"
        },
        {
            "d" : "-",
            "base" : "base != 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return DToA.JS_dtobasestr(base, d);"
        },
        {
            "d" : "-",
            "base" : "base == 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: The decision table is complete. For every possible combination of the inputs d and base, there is an applicable rule. The first four rules handle all special cases for d (NaN, positive infinity, negative infinity, zero), regardless of the value of base. If none of those cases match, the next three rules collectively cover all remaining values of base: invalid bases ((base < 2) || (base > 36)), non-decimal valid bases (base != 10), and decimal base (base == 10). Therefore, there is no input for which no rule would be applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: The inputs to the decision are the variables d and base.
