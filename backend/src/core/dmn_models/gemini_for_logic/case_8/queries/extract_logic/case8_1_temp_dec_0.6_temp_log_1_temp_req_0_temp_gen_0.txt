Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide? 

"""executeTargets(Project project, String[] targetNames)
        throws BuildException {
        BuildException thrownException = null;
        for (String targetName : targetNames) {
            try {
                project.executeTarget(targetName);
            } catch (BuildException ex) {
                if (project.isKeepGoingMode()) {
                    thrownException = ex;
                } else {
                    throw ex;
                }
            }
        }
        if (thrownException != null) {
            throw thrownException;
        }
    }""" 

A: This code decides how to proceed with executing a series of targets when an exception occurs during the execution of one of them, and which exception to ultimately throw if any failures were encountered.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function has a void return type, meaning it does not return any value.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The decision is influenced by the project's 'keep going mode' status (obtained via `project.isKeepGoingMode()`), any `BuildException` (referred to as `ex` in the code) caught when executing a target, and the `thrownException` variable, which stores the latest exception if 'keep going mode' is enabled and whose state determines if an exception is thrown after iterating through all targets.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The inputs that influence this decision, along with their data types and possible values, are:
1.  The `project` parameter: Its data type is the `Project` Java class. Its value is expected to be a valid instance of this class, which provides the context for execution, including the 'keep going mode'.
2.  The `targetNames` parameter: Its data type is an array of `String` values (`String[]`). Its possible values include an array containing zero or more strings, where each string is the name of a target to be executed, for example, `{"clean", "compile"}` or an empty array.
3.  The 'keep going mode' status, which is determined by calling `project.isKeepGoingMode()`: Its data type is `boolean`. Its possible values are `true`, indicating that execution should continue even if a target fails, or `false`, indicating that execution should stop on the first target failure.
4.  The outcome of executing an individual target, which results from calling `project.executeTarget(targetName)`: This outcome is effectively either a `BuildException` instance or a state of success. Its possible values for each target are an instance of `BuildException` if that specific target's execution fails, or an indicator of successful execution (no exception thrown) for that target.

The function has a `void` return type, meaning it does not directly return a data value. The primary "output" of the decision made by the code concerns whether an exception is ultimately thrown by this function:
1.  The function may throw a `BuildException`. The data type of this thrown exception is `BuildException`. The specific instance thrown will be the first `BuildException` encountered if the 'keep going mode' is `false`. If the 'keep going mode' is `true` and one or more target executions result in a `BuildException`, the thrown exception will be the last `BuildException` encountered.
2.  Alternatively, the function may complete its execution without throwing an exception. This occurs if all specified targets execute successfully.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The primary numerical variable that influences the execution flow detailed in this code is the number of elements in the `targetNames` array (i.e., `targetNames.length`). The relevant values for this numerical variable, which can lead to different execution paths or outcomes, are:
1.  `0` (zero): If there are no target names, the loop is not executed, no individual targets are processed, and the method will complete without throwing a `BuildException` from within the loop or the final check.
2.  `1` (one): If there is exactly one target name, the loop executes once for that single target. If this target's execution results in a `BuildException`, that exception will either be thrown immediately (if 'keep going mode' is `false`) or will be the exception thrown after the loop (if 'keep going mode' is `true`).
3.  `>1` (more than one): If there are multiple target names, the loop executes for each. This is particularly distinct when 'keep going mode' is `true`. If multiple targets fail, `thrownException` will be updated with each failure, and ultimately, only the `BuildException` from the *last* target in the sequence that failed will be thrown after the loop completes. If 'keep going mode' is `false`, an exception from the first failing target will be thrown immediately, and subsequent targets will not be processed.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
    "Conditions": {
        "project": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        },
        "thrownException": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions": {
        "executeTargets(Project project, String[] targetNames)": {
            "Type": "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [
        {
            "project": "!(project.isKeepGoingMode())",
            "thrownException": "-",
            "executeTargets(Project project, String[] targetNames)": "throw ex;"
        },
        {
            "project": "project.isKeepGoingMode()",
            "thrownException": "thrownException != null",
            "executeTargets(Project project, String[] targetNames)": "throw thrownException;"
        },
        {
            "project": "-",
            "thrownException": "!(thrownException != null)",
            "executeTargets(Project project, String[] targetNames)": null
        }
    ]
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete in the sense that for every possible combination of the boolean values for the DMN conditions (`project.isKeepGoingMode()` which evaluates from the `project` input, and `thrownException != null` which evaluates from the `thrownException` variable's state), at least one rule is applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: According to the table, the inputs to the decision are `project` and `thrownException`.
