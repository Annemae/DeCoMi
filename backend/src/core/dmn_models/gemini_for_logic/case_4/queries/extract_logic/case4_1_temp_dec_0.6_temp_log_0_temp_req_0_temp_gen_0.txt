Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides the string representation of an input object by applying type-specific rules, including special conversions for null, undefined, String, Number, and an iterative process for Scriptable objects that may result in an error, with a final fallback to the object's native toString method.

Q: What does the function return? 

A: The function returns a String, which represents the input object `val`. Specifically, it returns "null" for a null input, "undefined" for an `Undefined` instance, the input String itself if `val` is a String, a formatted numeric string if `val` is a Number, and the result of `val.toString()` for other types. For `Scriptable` objects, it first attempts to convert them to a default string value, which is then processed by the same logic; if this conversion to a non-Scriptable primitive fails, an error is thrown instead of a string being returned.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the input object `val` and, if `val` is a `Scriptable` object, the intermediate value obtained from its `getDefaultValue(StringClass)` method. This intermediate value is critical because `val` is reassigned to it, and the decision logic is then re-applied to this new state of `val` within a loop.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: For the input, the function `toString(Object val)` accepts one argument.
This input argument is named `val`. Its data type is `Object`, meaning it can be any Java object or the special `null` reference. The possible values for `val` include `null` itself; a specific singleton object `Undefined.instance`; any instance of `String`, representing textual data; any instance of `Number`, such as `Integer` or `Double`, which can represent various numerical values including special cases like `NaN` (Not a Number) or `Infinity`; any instance of an object that implements the `Scriptable` interface, which has a mechanism to be converted to a default primitive value; or an instance of any other Java class.

For the output, the function returns a value.
This output is a `String` that represents the input object `val` (or a value derived from it if `val` is `Scriptable`). The data type of the returned value is always `String`. Possible values for this output string include: the literal string `"null"` if the object being converted is `null`; the literal string `"undefined"` if the object is `Undefined.instance`; the original string itself if the object is already a `String`; a string representation of a number (such as `"42"`, `"3.14159"`, `"NaN"`, or `"Infinity"`) if the object is a `Number`; or the string result of calling the object's own `toString()` method if it does not fall into one of the previously mentioned categories. In the case of a `Scriptable` object, it is first asked for its default string value, which is then processed according to these same rules.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant numerical values that influence this decision primarily appear when the input `val` is an instance of `Number`. Firstly, the integer literal `10` is a significant numerical value, as it is passed as the radix to the `numberToString` method, dictating that the number should be converted to its decimal (base 10) string representation. Secondly, the specific `double` value resulting from `((Number)val).doubleValue()` is crucial. The relevance of this `double` value encompasses its entire possible range, including standard finite numbers (such as 0.0, -1.23, or 4.56e78), as well as special floating-point constants like `Double.NaN` (Not a Number), `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, and `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. These special constants, along with potentially distinct positive and negative zero values, often have unique string representations (e.g., "NaN", "Infinity") determined by the `numberToString` method.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
    "Conditions": {
        "val": {
            "Type": "Object"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions": {
        "toString(Object val)": {
            "Type": "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [
        {
            "val": "val == null",
            "toString(Object val)": "return \"null\";"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val == Undefined.instance",
            "toString(Object val)": "return \"undefined\";"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val != Undefined.instance && val instanceof String",
            "toString(Object val)": "return (String)val;"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val != Undefined.instance && !(val instanceof String) && val instanceof Number",
            "toString(Object val)": "return numberToString(((Number)val).doubleValue(), 10);"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val != Undefined.instance && !(val instanceof String) && !(val instanceof Number) && val instanceof Scriptable && ((Scriptable)val).getDefaultValue(StringClass) instanceof Scriptable",
            "toString(Object val)": "throw errorWithClassName(\"msg.primitive.expected\", ((Scriptable)val).getDefaultValue(StringClass));"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val != Undefined.instance && !(val instanceof String) && !(val instanceof Number) && val instanceof Scriptable && !(((Scriptable)val).getDefaultValue(StringClass) instanceof Scriptable)",
            "toString(Object val)": "continue;"
        },
        {
            "val": "val != null && val != Undefined.instance && !(val instanceof String) && !(val instanceof Number) && !(val instanceof Scriptable)",
            "toString(Object val)": "return val.toString();"
        }
    ]
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. According to the provided definition of completeness (i.e., there is an applicable rule for each set of inputs), this decision table fulfills the criterion. The conditions for `val` (being null, `Undefined.instance`, `String`, `Number`, `Scriptable`, or another type) and the further condition on the result of `getDefaultValue(StringClass)` for `Scriptable` objects are structured in such a way that they cover all possible scenarios for the input object `val`. Therefore, for any given `val`, one of the seven rules will have its conditions satisfied and will be applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What are the input to the decision? 

A: According to the table, the input to the decision is the variable `val`.
