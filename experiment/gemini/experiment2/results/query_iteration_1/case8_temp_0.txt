""" 

A: The code decides whether to stop the execution of a series of build targets immediately upon the first encountered build exception, or to attempt to execute all targets and then throw the first build exception that was encountered, if any.

Q: What does the executeTargets method do when the project parameter is in keep going mode? 

A: When the project parameter is in keep going mode, the `executeTargets` method attempts to execute all specified targets in the `targetNames` array, even if one or more of them throw a `BuildException`; if any target throws a `BuildException`, the first such exception encountered is stored, and after all targets have been attempted, this stored exception is thrown.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the boolean value returned by the `project.isKeepGoingMode()` method and the `BuildException` `ex` that is caught when a target's execution fails.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The inputs that influence this decision are:
1.  **`isKeepGoingMode`**:
    *   Data Type: This is a `boolean` value.
    *   Possible Values: `true`, indicating that the process should attempt to execute all targets even if errors occur, or `false`, indicating that the process should stop on the first error. This value is obtained from the `project.isKeepGoingMode()` method.
2.  **`targetExecutionException`**:
    *   Data Type: This is a `BuildException` object.
    *   Possible Values: An instance of `BuildException` that is caught when a specific target (`project.executeTarget(targetName)`) fails. If a target executes successfully, this input is not present for the decision logic within the `catch` block for that specific target.
3.  **`storedExceptionState`**:
    *   Data Type: This is a `BuildException` object, which can be `null`. It corresponds to the `thrownException` variable in the code.
    *   Possible Values: `null`, if no exception has been stored yet from a previous target failure in "keep going" mode, or an instance of `BuildException`, representing the first exception that was caught and stored.

The outputs, which are the results or behaviors determined by the decision logic, are:
1.  **`immediateResponseToTargetFailure`**:
    *   Data Type: This is a behavioral outcome.
    *   Possible Values:
        *   "Throw the `targetExecutionException` immediately": This happens if `isKeepGoingMode` is `false` and a `targetExecutionException` occurs, causing the `executeTargets` method to terminate.
        *   "Store the `targetExecutionException` and continue to the next target": This happens if `isKeepGoingMode` is `true`, a `targetExecutionException` occurs, and the `storedExceptionState` (the `thrownException` variable) is currently `null`. The `targetExecutionException` is then stored.
        *   "Continue to the next target without updating the stored exception": This happens if `isKeepGoingMode` is `true`, a `targetExecutionException` occurs, but the `storedExceptionState` (the `thrownException` variable) already holds a previously caught exception. The loop continues, and the already stored exception is preserved.
2.  **`finalMethodOutcome`**:
    *   Data Type: This is a behavioral outcome after all targets have been processed (or an immediate throw has occurred).
    *   Possible Values:
        *   "Throw the stored `BuildException`": This happens if the `storedExceptionState` (the final value of the `thrownException` variable) is not `null` after the loop finishes.
        *   "Complete execution normally": This happens if the `storedExceptionState` (the final value of the `thrownException` variable) is `null` after the loop finishes, meaning no exceptions were stored (either none occurred, or they were thrown immediately).

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: While the direct conditions in the `if` statements of the provided code do not involve numerical variables, the length of the `targetNames` array, which represents the number of targets to execute, is a numerical quantity that significantly influences the method's behavior and overall outcome. Let's refer to this as `numberOfTargets`.

*   **Data Type**: `numberOfTargets` is an integer.
*   **Possible Values**: Its possible values are any non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...).
*   **Relevance of Values**:
    *   If `numberOfTargets` is 0, no targets are processed because the execution loop is skipped. In this case, the `executeTargets` method will complete without throwing an exception that originates from a target's execution.
    *   If `numberOfTargets` is 1, a single target is processed. If this target's execution results in a `BuildException`, that exception is effectively both the "first" and "last" encountered exception. It will be thrown either immediately or after the loop completes, depending on the `project.isKeepGoingMode()` setting.
    *   If `numberOfTargets` is greater than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, ...), multiple targets are processed. This scenario highlights the difference in behavior based on the keep-going mode: if `project.isKeepGoingMode()` is `false`, the first `BuildException` encountered will be thrown immediately, and subsequent targets will not be executed. If `project.isKeepGoingMode()` is `true`, all targets will be attempted, and if multiple exceptions occur, the `BuildException` from the target that was processed latest in the sequence (the "last" exception) will be thrown after all targets have been attempted. The specific value of `numberOfTargets` determines the maximum number of loop iterations.

Could you generate a DMN decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"? If a decision is present, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code; otherwise, provide an empty JSON object. Do not interpret the decision, i.e., take the decision logic exactly as written in the source code. Do not write anything else. 

```json
{
    "Conditions": {
        "isKeepGoingMode": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions": {
        "actionOnCaughtBuildException": {
            "Type": "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [
        {
            "isKeepGoingMode": "project.isKeepGoingMode()",
            "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "thrownException = ex;"
        },
        {
            "isKeepGoingMode": "!(project.isKeepGoingMode())",
            "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "throw ex;"
        }
    ]
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, this table is complete. The decision table models the choice of action based on the boolean value of `project.isKeepGoingMode()`. The "Conditions" section effectively defines one input condition whose state is determined by `project.isKeepGoingMode()`.
The first rule, `{"isKeepGoingMode": "project.isKeepGoingMode()", "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "thrownException = ex;"}`, applies if the expression `project.isKeepGoingMode()` evaluates to true.
The second rule, `{"isKeepGoingMode": "!(project.isKeepGoingMode())", "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "throw ex;"}`, applies if the expression `!(project.isKeepGoingMode())` evaluates to true (which means `project.isKeepGoingMode()` evaluates to false).
Since `project.isKeepGoingMode()` must be either true or false, one of these two rules will always be applicable. Therefore, there is an applicable rule for every possible state of the input condition, making the table complete for the decision it models.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What happens when the thrownException local variable is not null? 

A: According to the provided DMN table, the decision logic that is modeled (which occurs within the `catch (BuildException ex)` block) depends solely on the boolean value of `project.isKeepGoingMode()`. The state of the `thrownException` local variable (i.e., whether it is null or not null due to a previously caught exception) is not an explicit input condition to this specific DMN table.

However, we can describe what happens based on the table's rules when a new `BuildException ex` is caught and `thrownException` is already not null (implying a previous target failed and `project.isKeepGoingMode()` was true at that time):

1.  The condition `isKeepGoingMode` (which corresponds to `project.isKeepGoingMode()` in the code) is evaluated.
2.  If `project.isKeepGoingMode()` is true:
    The DMN rule `{"isKeepGoingMode": "project.isKeepGoingMode()", "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "thrownException = ex;"}` applies.
    The specified action is `thrownException = ex;`. This means the `thrownException` variable, which was already holding a non-null `BuildException` object from a previous failure, will have its value overwritten by the newly caught `BuildException ex`. The execution will then continue to the next target in the loop.
3.  If `project.isKeepGoingMode()` is false:
    The DMN rule `{"isKeepGoingMode": "!(project.isKeepGoingMode())", "actionOnCaughtBuildException": "throw ex;"}` applies.
    The specified action is `throw ex;`. This means the newly caught `BuildException ex` is thrown immediately, and the `executeTargets` method terminates. In this case, the fact that `thrownException` was previously not null is irrelevant to this immediate action.

Therefore, if `thrownException` is already not null and `project.isKeepGoingMode()` remains true, the table dictates that `thrownException` will be updated with the latest caught exception. If `project.isKeepGoingMode()` is false, the current exception is thrown immediately, regardless of the prior state of `thrownException`.
