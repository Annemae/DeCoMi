""" 

A: This code decides the `double` number that is represented by a given string segment when interpreted in a specified radix.

Q: What is returned when the start parameter is equal to the end local variable? 

A: When the start parameter is equal to the end local variable, the code returns NaN.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The decision to return NaN, which occurs if the `start` parameter is equal to the `end` local variable, is influenced by the input string `s`, the input starting index `start`, and the input `radix`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:
For the inputs:
1.  `s`:
    *   Data Type: `String`
    *   Possible Values: Any valid Java string. It is expected to contain characters that can be interpreted as digits in the specified `radix`.
2.  `start`:
    *   Data Type: `int`
    *   Possible Values: Non-negative integers, typically ranging from 0 up to `s.length()`.
3.  `radix`:
    *   Data Type: `int`
    *   Possible Values: Integers. The code has specific logic for `radix < 10`, `radix > 10`, `radix == 10`, and `radix` being 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. Typically, radices range from 2 to 36 for number parsing.

For the output:
1.  Return value:
    *   Data Type: `double`
    *   Possible Values:
        *   A finite `double` value representing the number parsed from the string segment.
        *   `NaN` (Not a Number), for example, if the segment to parse is empty (i.e., `start` equals `end` initially) or if a `NumberFormatException` occurs in specific fallback scenarios.
        *   The value can also be positive or negative infinity if the number represented is too large or too small to fit into a `double`, though the code's primary focus seems to be on parsing valid numbers and handling precision for large integers.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values for the numerical variables in this code, which influence its execution paths and calculations, are as follows:

For the input variable `radix` (an `int`):
*   Its value relative to 10 (less than 10, equal to 10, or greater than 10) determines how character limits for digits are set.
*   Specific values of 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, or 32 trigger specialized high-precision handling if the parsed number (`sum`) is very large.
*   It generally represents the base of the number system, typically an integer from 2 to 36.

For the input variable `start` (an `int`):
*   Its equality with the local variable `end` after the initial digit parsing loop (e.g., if `start` still equals `end`) is a critical condition, often leading to a NaN result.
*   It is a non-negative integer, usually within the bounds of the input string `s`, indicating the starting position for parsing.

For the local variable `len` (an `int`):
*   Its value is the length of the input string `s`, a non-negative integer that defines the upper bound for the parsing loop.

For the local loop variable `end` (an `int`):
*   Its value, when compared to the `start` parameter after the initial parsing loop, indicates whether any valid digits were found; if `end` is equal to `start`, it implies no digits were parsed.

For the local variable `sum` (a `double`):
*   Its initial value is `0.0`.
*   The specific threshold `9007199254740992.0` (which is 2 to the power of 53) is important, as `sum` reaching or exceeding this value activates special precision logic for certain radices.

For the local variable `newDigit` (an `int`):
*   It takes integer values from `0` up to `radix - 1`, corresponding to the numerical value of each character parsed from the string.

Within the specialized precision handling logic (which runs if `sum` is large and `radix` is 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32):
*   For the local variable `bitShiftInChar` (an `int`):
    *   It is initialized to `1` before processing bits of the first character in this block.
    *   It is set to the value of `radix` when a new character is loaded.
    *   Its value is repeatedly right-shifted by 1 (effectively an integer division by 2) during bit extraction.
*   For the local variable `digit` (an `int`):
    *   It holds the integer value of a character being processed bit by bit, ranging from `0` up to `radix - 1`.
*   For the local variable `state` (an `int`):
    *   It can be `0` (SKIP_LEADING_ZEROS), `1` (FIRST_EXACT_53_BITS), `2` (AFTER_BIT_53), `3` (ZEROS_AFTER_54), or `4` (MIXED_AFTER_54), which are constant integer values guiding the state machine.
*   For the local variable `exactBitsLimit` (an `int`):
    *   Its initial value is `53`.
    *   The value `0` is a significant threshold that causes a change in the `state`.
*   For the local variable `factor` (a `double`):
    *   Its initial value is `0.0`.
    *   It is set to `2.0` when processing starts for bits beyond the 53rd significant bit.
    *   It is subsequently multiplied by `2.0` in certain states, accumulating powers of two.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete according to the definition provided (i.e., there is an applicable rule for each set of inputs, where "inputs" refer to the truth values of the conditions defined in the DMN table's `Conditions` section).

To verify this, let's consider all possible combinations of the boolean outcomes for the defined conditions:
1.  Condition `start, end` (representing `start == end`)
2.  Condition `sum` (representing `sum >= 9007199254740992.0`)
3.  Condition `radix` (representing `radix == 10`)

We can analyze the coverage:
*   **Case 1: `start == end` is true.**
    *   Rule 1 applies: (`start, end`: "start == end", `sum`: "-", `radix`: "-"). The values of `sum` and `radix` conditions do not matter. This case is covered.
*   **Case 2: `start == end` is false.**
    *   **Subcase 2a: `sum >= 9007199254740992.0` is false (i.e., `sum < 9007199254740992.0`).**
        *   Rule 4 applies: (`start, end`: "!(start == end)", `sum`: "sum < 9007199254740992.0", `radix`: "-"). The value of the `radix` condition does not matter. This case is covered.
    *   **Subcase 2b: `sum >= 9007199254740992.0` is true.**
        *   **Subcase 2b-i: `radix == 10` is true.**
            *   Rule 2 applies: (`start, end`: "!(start == end)", `sum`: "sum >= 9007199254740992.0", `radix`: "radix == 10").
            *   Rule 3 also applies with the same conditions but a different outcome, reflecting the two paths of the `try-catch` block. This set of input conditions has applicable rules.
        *   **Subcase 2b-ii: `radix == 10` is false (i.e., `!(radix == 10)` is true).**
            *   Rule 5 applies: (`start, end`: "!(start == end)", `sum`: "sum >= 9007199254740992.0", `radix`: "!(radix == 10)"). This case is covered.

Since all combinations of the input conditions defined for the DMN table have at least one applicable rule, the table is complete by the given definition.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What happens when a NumberFormatException is thrown? 

A: According to the provided DMN table, when the conditions are `!(start == end)`, `sum >= 9007199254740992.0`, and `radix == 10`, two rules (Rule 2 and Rule 3) have matching conditions. Rule 2 corresponds to the `try` block (`return Double.valueOf(s.substring(start, end)).doubleValue();`) and Rule 3 corresponds to the `catch (NumberFormatException nfe)` block (`return NaN;`). Therefore, if a `NumberFormatException` is thrown under these conditions, the outcome specified by Rule 3 is `return NaN;`.
