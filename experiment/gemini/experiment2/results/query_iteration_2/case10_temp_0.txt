Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides how to manage and display the progress of different "channels" in a tree-like user interface. Specifically, it makes the following decisions:
1.  It decides whether a new progress entry (a `ProgressNode`) for a given channel identifier (`id`) needs to be created if one does not already exist, or if an existing one should be used.
2.  It decides whether a main "files" node, intended to group these progress entries, needs to be added to the display tree if it is not already present.
3.  It decides whether to insert the specific channel's progress entry into this "files" node within the tree. This insertion occurs if either the channel's progress entry was newly created or if the "files" node itself was just added to the tree.
4.  It decides whether to remove a channel's progress entry from both an internal tracking collection (`progressNodes`) and from the "files" node in the display tree once its progress (`p`) reaches 1 (indicating 100% completion).

Q: What happens when the p parameter is equal to 1? 

A: When the p parameter is equal to 1, indicating completion, the code performs two removal operations: it removes the progress entry for the given channel identifier (`id`) from an internal collection (`progressNodes`), and it also removes the corresponding progress node (`pn`) from its parent `filesNode` within the display tree.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The decision to remove the progress entry and node when `p` is equal to 1 is influenced by the following variables:
1.  `p`: Its value must be 1 for the removal operations to be triggered.
2.  `id`: This parameter determines which specific progress entry is targeted for removal from the `progressNodes` collection.
3.  `progressNodes`: This is the collection from which the progress entry associated with `id` is removed; its state is relevant to the removal.
4.  `pn`: This variable holds the specific `ProgressNode` object that is to be removed from the `filesNode`. The value of `pn` is determined earlier in the method based on `id` and the contents of `progressNodes`.
5.  `filesNode`: This is the parent tree node from which the `pn` node is removed; its state (specifically, its children) is relevant to this removal.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: For the decision that occurs when the `p` parameter is equal to 1, the inputs influencing this specific part of the code and the outputs resulting from it are as follows:

**Inputs:**

*   The progress value, which is the parameter `p`.
    *   Its data type is `double`.
    *   Its possible values are floating-point numbers. In the context of this method, `p` typically represents progress and would range from 0.0 (0% complete) to 1.0 (100% complete). The decision is specifically triggered if this value is equal to 1.0.
*   The channel identifier, which is the parameter `id`.
    *   Its data type is `String`.
    *   Its possible values are any non-null string that serves as a unique identifier for the channel or task whose progress is being reported.
*   The collection of active progress entries, named `progressNodes`.
    *   Its data type is inferred to be a map-like collection, such as `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>`, where keys are `String` identifiers and values are `ProgressNode` objects.
    *   Its possible values describe its state before this decision's action: it can be an empty collection or contain multiple `String`-to-`ProgressNode` mappings. For the removal operation to have an effect, this collection must contain an entry with the key `id`.
*   The specific progress node object, named `pn`.
    *   Its data type is `ProgressNode`, which is a custom class likely representing a node in a user interface tree.
    *   Its possible values are instances of this `ProgressNode` class. The specific instance `pn` is the one associated with the channel `id`, obtained or created earlier in the method.
*   The parent "files" tree node, named `filesNode`.
    *   Its data type is a tree node object, likely compatible with `javax.swing.tree.MutableTreeNode` or a similar custom tree node class.
    *   Its possible values describe its state before this decision's action: it is an instance of this tree node class. For the removal of `pn` to be effective, `pn` should be a child of this `filesNode`.

**Outputs (these are the effects on the system's state if `p` is equal to 1):**

*   The updated state of the `progressNodes` collection.
    *   Its data type remains the same as its input type (e.g., `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>`).
    *   Its resulting state, if `p` was 1, is that the entry associated with the `id` key is removed from this collection. If the `id` was not present as a key, the collection's state regarding this `id` is unchanged by this specific removal action.
*   The updated state of the `filesNode` tree node.
    *   Its data type remains the same as its input type (e.g., `javax.swing.tree.MutableTreeNode`).
    *   Its resulting state, if `p` was 1, is that the `ProgressNode` object `pn` is removed from the list of `filesNode`'s children. If `pn` was not a child of `filesNode` (which would imply an inconsistent state or specific behavior of the `remove` method), the `filesNode` might remain unchanged or an error could occur, depending on the tree model's implementation.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: For the decision that occurs when the `p` parameter is equal to 1, the primary numerical variable whose value is directly evaluated is `p`. The relevant values for `p` concerning this specific decision are:
*   `1.0`: This value is relevant because it is the specific value that `p` is compared against. If `p` is equal to `1.0`, it signifies completion, causing the condition `p == 1` to be true and the subsequent removal logic to be executed.
*   Any value other than `1.0`: All other possible numerical values for `p` (e.g., values in the typical progress range `[0.0, 1.0)`, or potentially values outside this range if they can occur) are relevant because they result in the condition `p == 1` being false. In such cases, the removal logic associated with completion is skipped.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

```json
{
}
```

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What does the channelsProgress method return? 

A: The generated table is empty. This means that according to the specified extraction rules, which look for decisions directly influencing an exit statement (like `return` or `throw`), no such decisions were found in the `channelsProgress` method to model. Since the table contains no rules, no rule is applicable for any set of inputs. For example, for inputs `id = "test"` and `p = 0.5`, no rule in the empty table would apply. In the context of DMN, a table that provides no applicable rule for valid inputs is considered incomplete.
