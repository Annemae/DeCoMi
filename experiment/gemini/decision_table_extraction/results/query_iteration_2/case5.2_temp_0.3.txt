""" 

A: This code decides the double-precision floating-point numerical value that a given substring represents when interpreted in a specified radix.

Q: What is returned when the start parameter is equal to the end local variable? 

A: When the start parameter is equal to the end local variable, the code returns NaN.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are `s`, `start`, `radix`, `len`, `digitMax`, `lowerCaseBound`, `upperCaseBound`, and `end`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: For the inputs to the `stringToNumber` function:
The first input is `s`. Its data type is `String`. Its possible values encompass any valid Java string, as the function will attempt to parse a numerical value from a segment of this string.
The second input is `start`. Its data type is `int`. Its possible values are non-negative integers that indicate the starting index within the string `s` from which the number parsing should commence; typically, this value ranges from `0` up to the length of the string `s`.
The third input is `radix`. Its data type is `int`. Its possible values are integers that specify the numerical base for interpreting the string; these values typically range from 2 to 36, inclusive, for standard number system representations.

For the output of the `stringToNumber` function:
The output is the `double` precision floating-point number returned by the function. Its data type is `double`. Its possible values include:
1.  A non-negative finite numerical value, if the substring is successfully parsed into such a number (e.g., 0.0, 123.0).
2.  `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, if the magnitude of the parsed number exceeds the maximum representable `double` value.
3.  `Double.NaN` (Not a Number), if no valid digits are found at or after the `start` index according to the specified `radix`, or if an internal error occurs during specific fallback parsing procedures for very large decimal numbers.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables in this code, which influence its decisions and calculations, are as follows:

1.  For the input `radix` (an `int`):
    *   Values less than 10 (e.g., `radix < 10`) determine the upper character bound for numerical digits.
    *   Values greater than 10 (e.g., `radix > 10`) determine the character bounds for alphabetical digits.
    *   The specific value `10` enables a fallback to `Double.valueOf()` for large numbers if `sum` is `9007199254740992.0` or greater.
    *   Specific values `2, 4, 8, 16, 32` trigger a custom bit-level precision handling logic for large numbers if `sum` is `9007199254740992.0` or greater.
    *   The typical operational range is from 2 to 36.

2.  For the input `start` (an `int`):
    *   Its value relative to `len` (the string length) is critical; parsing occurs from index `start` up to, but not including, `len`.
    *   Its value is compared to the local variable `end` after the initial parsing loop; if `start == end`, it indicates no valid digits were found, leading to a `NaN` return.

3.  For the local variable `len` (an `int`):
    *   Its value is `s.length()`, the length of the input string. It serves as the exclusive upper bound for the main parsing loop.

4.  For the local variable `end` (an `int`):
    *   Its value, after the main parsing loop, is compared to `start`. If they are equal, it means no digits were parsed.
    *   It marks the end index of the substring that is processed for number conversion.

5.  For the local variable `sum` (a `double`):
    *   Its initial value is `0.0`.
    *   A critical threshold is `9007199254740992.0` (which is 2^53). If `sum` reaches or exceeds this value, special precision handling is activated for certain radixes.
    *   In the special bit-level parsing logic (for radix 2, 4, 8, 16, 32):
        *   It can be set to `0.0` if no significant bits are found.
        *   It can be set to `1.0` when the first significant bit ('1') is encountered.
        *   It can be incremented by `1.0` as part of rounding logic.

6.  For the local variable `newDigit` (an `int`):
    *   Its values range from `0` to `radix - 1`, representing the numerical value of a successfully parsed character.

7.  For the local variable `digitMax` (a `char`):
    *   If `radix < 10`, its value is `(char)('0' + radix - 1)`. Otherwise, its default relevant value is `'9'`. This character's numerical (ASCII) value is used in comparisons.

8.  For the local variable `lowerCaseBound` (a `char`):
    *   If `radix > 10`, its value is `(char)('a' + radix - 10)`. Otherwise, its default relevant value is `'a'`. This character's numerical value is used in comparisons.

9.  For the local variable `upperCaseBound` (a `char`):
    *   If `radix > 10`, its value is `(char)('A' + radix - 10)`. Otherwise, its default relevant value is `'A'`. This character's numerical value is used in comparisons.

10. For numerical variables within the special precision handling block (active when `sum >= 9007199254740992.0` and `radix` is 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32):
    *   For `state` (an `int`): It takes on the discrete integer values `0` (SKIP_LEADING_ZEROS), `1` (FIRST_EXACT_53_BITS), `2` (AFTER_BIT_53), `3` (ZEROS_AFTER_54), or `4` (MIXED_AFTER_54), which define the stages of bit processing.
    *   For `exactBitsLimit` (an `int`): Its initial value is `53`. It is decremented with each significant bit processed, and reaching `0` is a key transition point.
    *   For `bitShiftInChar` (an `int`): It is initialized to `1`. When a new character is to be processed (if `bitShiftInChar == 1`), `bitShiftInChar` is set to the current `radix`. It is then right-shifted (`>>= 1`) in each iteration of the inner bit-extraction loop. Its values effectively become `radix/2, radix/4, ..., 1` for extracting bits from `digit`.
    *   For `digit` (an `int`): It holds the integer value of the current character being processed for its bits, ranging from `0` to `radix - 1`.
    *   For `factor` (a `double`): Its initial value is `0.0`. It is set to `2.0` after the 53rd bit is processed and is subsequently multiplied by `2.0` for each bit processed after the 54th, taking values like `2.0, 4.0, 8.0, ...`.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. For every possible combination of the input conditions as defined in the DMN table (`start == end`, `sum >= 9007199254740992.0`, `radix == 10`, and `radix == 2 || radix == 4 || radix == 8 || radix == 16 || radix == 32`), there is at least one applicable rule.

Let's verify this:
1.  If `start == end` is true: Rule 1 applies.
2.  If `start == end` is false:
    a.  And `sum >= 9007199254740992.0` is true:
        i.  And `radix == 10` is true: Rules 2 and 3 apply (covering the `try` and `catch` outcomes).
        ii. And `radix == 10` is false, but `(radix == 2 || radix == 4 || radix == 8 || radix == 16 || radix == 32)` is true: Rule 4 applies.
        iii.And `radix == 10` is false, and `(radix == 2 || radix == 4 || radix == 8 || radix == 16 || radix == 32)` is false: Rule 5 applies.
        These three sub-conditions for `radix` (i, ii, iii) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for all possible `radix` values when `sum` is large and `start != end`.
    b.  And `sum >= 9007199254740992.0` is false (i.e., `sum < 9007199254740992.0`): Rule 6 applies, irrespective of the `radix` value for this branch.

Since all logical combinations of the conditions defined in the table lead to an applicable rule, the table is complete and no example input set (in terms of the DMN condition outcomes) would result in no applicable rule. The duplication of conditions for Rules 2 and 3 addresses the two possible outcomes from the `try-catch` block under the same explicit `if` conditions.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What happens when a NumberFormatException is thrown? 

A: According to the provided DMN table, when the conditions `!(start == end)`, `sum >= 9007199254740992.0`, and `radix == 10` are met, there are two rules (Rule 2 and Rule 3) with identical conditions. Rule 2 corresponds to the successful execution of `Double.valueOf(s.substring(start, end)).doubleValue()`, while Rule 3, with the conclusion `"return NaN;"`, corresponds to the case where a `NumberFormatException` is caught. Therefore, when a `NumberFormatException` is thrown under these conditions, the table indicates that the function returns `NaN`.
