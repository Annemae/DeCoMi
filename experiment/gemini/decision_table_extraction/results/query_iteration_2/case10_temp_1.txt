Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides how to update a tree display showing channel progress by creating nodes for new channels or a general file grouping if they don't already exist, inserting these nodes into the tree structure, and removing channel nodes once their associated progress is complete.

Q: What happens when the p parameter is equal to 1? 

A: When the p parameter is equal to 1, the code removes the progress node associated with the given id from an internal tracking map called progressNodes and also removes that same progress node from a parent node in the tree structure called filesNode.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the `id` parameter, the `p` parameter, the current contents of the `progressNodes` map (specifically, whether an entry for the given `id` already exists), and the boolean state of `filesNodeInTree`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The inputs to the `channelsProgress` method, along with their data types and possible values, are as follows:
1.  **`id` parameter:**
    *   Data Type: `String`.
    *   Possible Values: Any string of characters, which typically serves as a unique identifier for a channel or file transfer. It is expected to be a non-null value.
2.  **`p` parameter:**
    *   Data Type: `double`.
    *   Possible Values: Any double-precision floating-point number. In the context of progress, this value is generally expected to range from 0.0 (indicating 0% progress) to 1.0 (indicating 100% completion). The value 1.0 has special handling for completion.
3.  **State of the `progressNodes` instance variable:**
    *   Data Type: This is a map, likely `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>`, where keys are `String` identifiers and values are `ProgressNode` objects.
    *   Possible Values: The relevant aspect of its state is whether it currently contains a mapping for the input `id`. It can range from being empty to containing multiple entries.
4.  **State of the `filesNodeInTree` instance variable:**
    *   Data Type: `boolean`.
    *   Possible Values: `true` or `false`, indicating whether a specific node representing a collection of files is already present in the displayed tree.

The outputs of this method, which are side effects as the method has a `void` return type, involve modifications to instance variables and the objects they reference:
1.  **`progressNodes` instance variable:**
    *   Data Type: `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>`.
    *   Nature of Change: The contents of this map are modified. A new entry, mapping the `id` to a newly created `ProgressNode` object, may be added if one doesn't already exist. If `p` is equal to 1, the entry associated with `id` is removed from the map.
2.  **`filesNodeInTree` instance variable:**
    *   Data Type: `boolean`.
    *   Nature of Change: This flag can be set to `true` if it was previously `false` and the `filesNode` is added to the tree.
3.  **`ProgressNode` objects:**
    *   Data Type: Instances of a custom `ProgressNode` class.
    *   Nature of Change: A new `ProgressNode` object may be instantiated. The progress value of the `ProgressNode` associated with the given `id` (whether newly created or pre-existing) is updated by calling its `setProgress(p)` method.
4.  **Tree structure managed by the `model` instance variable:**
    *   Data Type: An object implementing a tree model interface (e.g., `javax.swing.tree.TreeModel`).
    *   Nature of Change: The tree's structure is altered. If the `filesNode` is not yet in the tree, it is inserted into the `rootNode`. If a `ProgressNode` for the `id` is newly associated (either brand new or newly added to the tree logic in this call), it is inserted as a child of `filesNode`.
5.  **`filesNode` instance variable (representing a tree node):**
    *   Data Type: An object representing a node in the tree (e.g., `javax.swing.tree.MutableTreeNode`).
    *   Nature of Change: If `p` is equal to 1, the `ProgressNode` associated with `id` is removed as a child from `filesNode`.
6.  **`dataTree` instance variable (UI component):**
    *   Data Type: A UI component for displaying a tree (e.g., `javax.swing.JTree`).
    *   Nature of Change: The visual representation of the tree is updated. Specifically, the path to `filesNode` may be expanded, and the entire tree is repainted to reflect any structural or data changes.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The primary numerical variable whose values directly determine distinct behaviors within this code is the `p` parameter. For this `double` variable `p`:
*   The value `1.0` is a relevant value. When `p` is equal to `1.0`, it signifies that the progress is complete. This specific value triggers the removal of the corresponding progress node from an internal tracking map (`progressNodes`) and from its parent node in the tree structure (`filesNode`).
*   Any value of `p` not equal to `1.0` is also relevant, as this implies progress is not yet complete. These values typically represent ongoing progress levels, usually expected to be in the range of `0.0` (inclusive) to `1.0` (exclusive). For such values, the progress information of the node associated with the `id` is updated to reflect the new progress level, but the node itself is not removed based on this condition.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

```json
{
}
```

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What does the channelsProgress method return? 

A: The table is incomplete because it contains no decision rules. Therefore, for any set of inputs, no rule from the table is applicable. For instance, if the input `id` is "channelX" and the input `p` is 0.75, no rule from the empty table would apply.
