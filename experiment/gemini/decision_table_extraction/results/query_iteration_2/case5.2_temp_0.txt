""" 

A: This code decides the double-precision floating-point value of a number represented by a segment of a string in a given radix.

Q: What is returned when the start parameter is equal to the end local variable? 

A: When the start parameter is equal to the end local variable, the code returns NaN.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the method parameters `start`, `s`, and `radix`, as well as the local variables `end`, `len`, `c`, `digitMax`, `lowerCaseBound`, and `upperCaseBound`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: For the inputs:
1.  The parameter `s` is of type `String`. Its possible values are any valid Java string, which is expected to contain characters representing digits for the given `radix` within the specified `start` and `end` indices.
2.  The parameter `start` is of type `int`. Its possible values are non-negative integers, typically representing a valid starting index within the string `s`. It should generally be less than the length of `s`.
3.  The parameter `radix` is of type `int`. Its possible values are integers representing the base of the number. The code handles radices less than 10, greater than 10, equal to 10, and specific power-of-two radices (2, 4, 8, 16, 32). Typically, radix values range from 2 to 36.

For the output:
1.  The method returns a value of type `double`. Its possible values include:
    *   A finite double-precision floating-point number representing the parsed numeric value from the string segment.
    *   `NaN` (Not a Number), if no valid digits are found (i.e., `start` equals `end` after the parsing loop) or if a `NumberFormatException` occurs during an internal conversion for radix 10.
    *   Potentially `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` if the magnitude of the parsed number exceeds the representable range of a `double`.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables, which influence the code's logic and calculations, are as follows:

1.  **`radix` (int)**:
    *   Its value relative to 10 is important: whether it is less than 10, equal to 10, or greater than 10 affects how the character bounds (`digitMax`, `lowerCaseBound`, `upperCaseBound`) for valid digits are determined.
    *   The specific integer values 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 are relevant because if the `radix` is one of these and the calculated `sum` is very large, a special high-precision parsing logic is triggered.

2.  **`start` (int)**:
    *   Its initial value, provided as an input, marks the beginning of the string segment to parse.
    *   Its value is compared to the local variable `end` after the initial digit parsing loop. If `start` equals `end` at this point, it means no valid digits were found in the specified segment.

3.  **`end` (int)**:
    *   This variable tracks the current parsing position within the string. Its value relative to `start` after the first loop is critical: if `start == end`, it indicates an empty or invalid number string segment.
    *   Its value relative to `len` (string length) controls the parsing loop.

4.  **`len` (int)**:
    *   This variable holds the length of the input string `s`. Its value serves as the boundary for the parsing loop that iterates with `end`.

5.  **`sum` (double)**:
    *   A crucial threshold for `sum` is `9007199254740992.0` (which is 2^53). If the accumulated `sum` is greater than or equal to this value, the code invokes special handling to mitigate potential floating-point inaccuracies.
    *   Its initial value is `0.0`.
    *   Within the high-precision logic for power-of-two radices, `sum` is re-calculated, often starting from `0.0` or `1.0`, to represent the mantissa of the number.

6.  **`newDigit` (int)**:
    *   This variable holds the integer value of each character parsed in the main loop. Its possible values range from `0` to `radix - 1`.

7.  **`digitMax` (char)**:
    *   If `radix` is less than 10, `digitMax` is set to the character representing `radix - 1` (e.g., `'7'` if `radix` is 8). Otherwise, `digitMax` is `'9'`. This character defines the maximum valid numerical digit ('0' through '9').

8.  **`lowerCaseBound` (char)** and **`upperCaseBound` (char)**:
    *   If `radix` is greater than 10, `lowerCaseBound` is set to the character `'a' + radix - 10` (e.g., `'f'` if `radix` is 16, assuming it's exclusive bound, or the character for value `radix-1` if inclusive). The code uses `< lowerCaseBound`, so it's an exclusive upper bound. For example, if `radix` is 16, `lowerCaseBound` becomes `'a' + 16 - 10 = 'a' + 6 = 'g'`. Valid characters are 'a' through 'f'. Similarly for `upperCaseBound` with `'A'`. These define the range of valid alphabetic characters for digits.

9.  **`state` (int)** (used in the high-precision logic for specific power-of-two radices):
    *   This variable takes one of five specific integer values, represented by constants: `SKIP_LEADING_ZEROS` (0), `FIRST_EXACT_53_BITS` (1), `AFTER_BIT_53` (2), `ZEROS_AFTER_54` (3), or `MIXED_AFTER_54` (4). These values control the flow of a state machine that processes the number bit by bit.

10. **`exactBitsLimit` (int)** (used in the high-precision logic):
    *   It is initialized to `53`. A value of `0` for this variable is significant, as it indicates that the first 53 significant bits of the number have been processed, triggering a state change in the precision handling logic.

11. **`bitShiftInChar` (int)** (used in the high-precision logic):
    *   It is initialized to the `radix` (which is a power of two in this context, e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). When `bitShiftInChar` becomes `1` through repeated right-shifting, it signifies that all bits from the current character `digit` have been processed, and a new character needs to be fetched.

12. **`digit` (int)** (used in the high-precision logic, distinct from `newDigit`):
    *   This variable holds the integer value (from `0` to `radix - 1`) of the current character whose bits are being extracted one by one in the high-precision parsing logic.

13. **`factor` (double)** (used in the high-precision logic):
    *   This variable is initialized to `0.0`, then typically set to `2.0`, and subsequently multiplied by `2.0` in a loop. Its values are powers of two (e.g., 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, ...) and are used at the end of the high-precision calculation to scale the reconstructed `sum` (mantissa) to its correct magnitude.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. For every possible combination of the defined input conditions (`is_empty_segment`, `is_sum_large`, `is_radix_10`, `is_radix_special_power_of_2`, `conversion_causes_NFE`), considering their logical interdependencies (such as if `is_radix_10` is true, then `is_radix_special_power_of_2` is false, and `conversion_causes_NFE` is only relevant under specific preceding conditions), there is an applicable rule in the decision table. The rules provided cover all distinct execution paths leading to a return statement in the Java code.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What happens when a NumberFormatException is thrown? 

A: According to the table, when a NumberFormatException is thrown (which corresponds to the condition `conversion_causes_NFE` being "true" under the specific circumstances where `is_empty_segment` is "!(start == end)", `is_sum_large` is "sum >= 9007199254740992.0", and `is_radix_10` is "radix == 10"), the function returns NaN.
