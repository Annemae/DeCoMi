Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

""" 

A: This code decides the string representation of a double-precision floating-point number, taking into account special values like NaN, Infinity, -Infinity, and zero, as well as a specified numerical base for the conversion, which must be between 2 and 36 inclusive.

Q: What is returned when the d parameter is equal to 0.0? 

A: When the d parameter is equal to 0.0, the string "0" is returned.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the double-precision floating-point number `d` and the integer `base`.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The inputs to this code are `d` and `base`, and the output is a string.
Regarding the input `d`, its data type is `double`. It can accept any valid double-precision floating-point value, which includes positive and negative finite numbers, positive zero, negative zero, as well as special values like `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, and `Double.NaN`.
Concerning the input `base`, its data type is `int`. While it can technically be any integer, the function requires this `base` to be an integer value from 2 to 36, inclusive, for a successful conversion without errors; values outside this range will trigger a runtime error.
The output of the function is of data type `String`. The actual string returned is determined by the input values. Specifically, it will be the string `"NaN"` if `d` is `Double.NaN`, `"Infinity"` if `d` is `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `"-Infinity"` if `d` is `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, or `"0"` if `d` is `0.0`. For other finite non-zero `d` values and a valid `base` (between 2 and 36), the output is a string representing the number `d` in that numerical `base`. This representation is in standard decimal format when `base` is 10, and in a format specific to the given `base` when `base` is not 10.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: For the variable `d`, the relevant values are `Double.NaN`, `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `0.0`, and any other finite non-zero double value.
For the variable `base`, the relevant values are integers less than 2, integers greater than 36, the integer 10, and integers between 2 and 36 (inclusive) that are not equal to 10.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "throw Context.reportRuntimeError1(\"msg.bad.radix\", Integer.toString(base));"
        },
        {
            "d" : "(d == d) && (d != Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) && (d != Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) && (d != 0.0)",

            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return DToA.JS_dtobasestr(base, d);"

            "numberToString(double d, int base)" : "return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, the table is complete. The conditions for the variable `d` systematically address all its possible states: `NaN` (covered by `d != d`), `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, `0.0`, and any other finite non-zero double value. For each of the first four specific states of `d`, a rule is defined where the `base` value is irrelevant. If `d` is a finite, non-zero number, the conditions for the `base` variable then cover all integer possibilities: values outside the range [2, 36] (i.e., `base < 2` or `base > 36`), values within the range [2, 36] that are not equal to 10, and the value 10 (which is also within the range [2, 36]). The structure of the decision rules, where each subsequent rule for `d` (and similarly for `base` within its block) implicitly assumes the falsity of preceding, more specific conditions, ensures that for any given pair of `d` and `base` inputs, exactly one rule will have all its conditions satisfied.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What is returned when the base parameter is smaller than 2? 

A: According to the table, when the `base` parameter is smaller than 2: if the `d` parameter is `NaN` (satisfying `d != d`), `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, or `0.0`, the function returns the respective string `"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"`, or `"0"`, as these cases are covered by the first four decision rules where the `base` condition is `"-"` (don't care). If `d` is any other finite non-zero double value (satisfying the `d` condition `(d == d) && (d != Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) && (d != Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) && (d != 0.0)` of the fifth rule), and `base` is smaller than 2 (satisfying the `base` condition `(base < 2) || (base > 36)` of the fifth rule), then the execution results in `throw Context.reportRuntimeError1("msg.bad.radix", Integer.toString(base));`.
