Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

""" 

A: This code decides which actions to perform on a tree-based user interface and its associated data structures to accurately reflect a reported progress update for a channel.

Q: What happens when the p parameter is equal to 1? 

A: When the p parameter is equal to 1, the code removes the ProgressNode corresponding to the given id from its tracking collection, and it also removes this ProgressNode from its parent node in the tree display.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are the parameter p, the parameter id, the progressNodes collection, the ProgressNode object pn, and the filesNode object.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A: The inputs influencing the decision are:
1.  The `id` parameter:
    *   Data type: `String`.
    *   Possible values: This is a string that typically serves as a unique identifier for a specific channel or operation whose progress is being reported. Any non-null string value is possible.
2.  The `p` parameter:
    *   Data type: `double`.
    *   Possible values: This is a floating-point number representing the progress level. While it can be any double, it conventionally ranges from 0.0 (meaning 0% progress) to 1.0 (meaning 100% progress or completion). The code has specific logic for `p == 1.0`.
3.  The `progressNodes` instance variable:
    *   Data type: This is a collection, likely a `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>`, that stores `ProgressNode` objects, using their string identifiers as keys.
    *   Possible values: It can be empty or contain multiple `ProgressNode` entries. The presence or absence of an entry for the given `id` influences the method's behavior.
4.  The `filesNodeInTree` instance variable:
    *   Data type: `boolean`.
    *   Possible values: `true` or `false`. This variable tracks whether the `filesNode` has already been added to the main tree structure.
5.  The `model` instance variable:
    *   Data type: This is an object that manages the data structure of the tree, likely an implementation of an interface like `javax.swing.tree.TreeModel`.
    *   Possible values: It refers to an existing tree model instance.
6.  The `filesNode` instance variable:
    *   Data type: This is an object representing a node within the tree, likely an implementation of `javax.swing.tree.TreeNode`.
    *   Possible values: It refers to an existing tree node, which seems to serve as a parent or container for individual progress items.
7.  The `rootNode` instance variable:
    *   Data type: This is an object representing the root node of the tree, likely an implementation of `javax.swing.tree.TreeNode`.
    *   Possible values: It refers to the existing root node of the `dataTree`.

The outputs, which are primarily side effects as the method returns `void`, are:
1.  Modification of the `progressNodes` instance variable:
    *   Data type: `java.util.Map<String, ProgressNode>` (as described for input).
    *   Possible values: If no `ProgressNode` for the given `id` exists, a new one is created and added to this map. If `p` is 1.0, the `ProgressNode` associated with `id` is removed from this map.
2.  Modification of the `filesNodeInTree` instance variable:
    *   Data type: `boolean`.
    *   Possible values: It can be set to `true` if it was previously `false` and the `filesNode` was inserted into the tree.
3.  Changes to the state of `ProgressNode` objects:
    *   Data type: Individual `ProgressNode` objects (a custom class).
    *   Possible values: The progress value of the `ProgressNode` (either newly created or retrieved for the given `id`) is updated to the value of `p` by calling its `setProgress` method.
4.  Changes to the tree structure managed by `model`:
    *   Data type: The hierarchical structure represented by the tree model.
    *   Possible values:
        *   The `filesNode` might be inserted as a child of `rootNode` if it wasn't already in the tree.
        *   The `ProgressNode` (represented by `pn`) might be inserted as a child of `filesNode` if it's a new insertion.
        *   If `p` is 1.0, the `ProgressNode` (`pn`) is removed as a child from `filesNode`.
5.  Updates to the `dataTree` user interface component:
    *   Data type: The visual state of the tree UI component (e.g., `javax.swing.JTree`).
    *   Possible values:
        *   If a new `ProgressNode` or `filesNode` is inserted, the tree path leading to `filesNode` might be expanded to make it visible.
        *   The `dataTree` is instructed to repaint itself, ensuring that all visual changes reflecting the updated data and structure are displayed to the user.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant numerical variables and their values that influence the decisions and actions within this code are:

1.  The parameter `p`:
    *   Data type: `double`.
    *   Relevant value `1.0`: This specific value signifies that the operation whose progress is being tracked has completed. When `p` is `1.0`, the code triggers logic to remove the `ProgressNode` (associated with `id`) from the `progressNodes` collection and also removes it from its parent `filesNode` within the tree structure.
    *   Relevant values other than `1.0` (typically expected to be in the range `[0.0, 1.0)`): These values represent ongoing progress. For such values, the `ProgressNode` object (`pn`) has its progress state updated via `pn.setProgress(p)`, but the specific removal logic associated with `p == 1.0` is not executed.

2.  The index for node insertion into the tree model:
    *   Data type: `int` (this is provided as a literal `0` to the `insertNodeInto` method of the `model` object).
    *   Relevant value `0`: This numerical literal is consistently used as the index when the `filesNode` is inserted as a child of `rootNode`, and when a `ProgressNode` (`pn`) is inserted as a child of `filesNode`. The value `0` specifies that these new nodes are to be inserted at the beginning (i.e., the first position) of their parent node's list of children. While `0` is a literal in the code, it's a specific numerical choice that determines the position of new nodes in the tree.

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

```json
{
}
```

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What does the channelsProgress method return? 

```json
{
}
```
