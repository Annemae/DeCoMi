Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides how to convert a given double-precision floating-point number (d) into its string representation based on a specified numerical base (base). It handles special cases such as NaN (not a number), positive infinity, negative infinity, and zero, returning standard string representations for these values. For other numbers, it converts the number to a string in the given base, provided the base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive); otherwise, it throws an error for invalid bases. If the base is 10, it uses a specific formatting function for decimal conversion; for other bases, it calls a different method to handle conversion to that base.

Q: What is returned when the d parameter is equal to 0.0? 

A: When the d parameter is equal to 0.0, the method returns the string "0".

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are d (the double value to be converted) and base (the integer specifying the numerical base for conversion).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
Input 1:  
- Name: d  
- Data type: double (primitive floating-point number in Java)  
- Possible values: Any valid double value, including finite numbers (positive and negative), 0.0, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, and Double.NaN.

Input 2:  
- Name: base  
- Data type: int (primitive integer in Java)  
- Possible values: Any integer, but for the main conversion logic, only values between 2 and 36 (inclusive) are allowed; otherwise, an exception is thrown.

Output:  
- Data type: String  
- Possible values:  
  - "NaN" if d is not a number (Double.NaN)  
  - "Infinity" if d is positive infinity  
  - "-Infinity" if d is negative infinity  
  - "0" if d is zero (0.0)  
  - Otherwise, a string representing the numeric value of d in the specified base (from 2 to 36), formatted accordingly (e.g., "10", "a", "ff", etc.), or in decimal format if base is 10. If base is outside the 2–36 range, a runtime exception is thrown instead of returning a string.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are as follows:

For d (the double value):
- NaN (Not a Number), represented by Double.NaN.
- Positive infinity, represented by Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
- Negative infinity, represented by Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
- 0.0 (zero).
- Any other finite double value (positive or negative).

For base (the integer specifying the numerical base):
- Values less than 2 or greater than 36 are considered invalid and cause a runtime exception.
- Values from 2 to 36 (inclusive) are valid and are used for numeric conversion.
- Specifically, the value 10 is handled differently, using a decimal formatting function; all other valid bases use a separate conversion method.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

{
    "Conditions": {
        "d": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        },
        "base": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions": {
        "numberToString(double d, int base)": {
            "Type": "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [
        {
            "d": "d != d",
            "base": "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return \"NaN\";"
        },
        {
            "d": "d == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY",
            "base": "-",

            "base": "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return \"-Infinity\";"
        },
        {
            "d": "d == 0.0",
            "base": "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return \"0\";"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "(base < 2) || (base > 36)",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "throw Context.reportRuntimeError1(\"msg.bad.radix\", Integer.toString(base));"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base != 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return DToA.JS_dtobasestr(base, d);"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base == 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: Yes, this table is complete. For any possible combination of the inputs d and base, there is an applicable rule among the listed decision rules:

- If d is NaN, rule 1 applies.
- If d is positive infinity, rule 2 applies.
- If d is negative infinity, rule 3 applies.
- If d is 0.0, rule 4 applies.
- For any other d, if base is invalid ((base < 2) || (base > 36)), rule 5 applies.
- For any other d, if base is valid but not 10 (base != 10), rule 6 applies.
- For any other d, if base is 10 (base == 10), rule 7 applies.

There is no set of inputs for which none of the rules would apply, so the table covers all possible cases.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What is returned when the base parameter is smaller than 2? 

A: When the base parameter is smaller than 2, the method throws an exception by executing the statement: throw Context.reportRuntimeError1("msg.bad.radix", Integer.toString(base));
