Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides how to convert a given double-precision floating-point number (d) into its string representation in a specified numeral base (base). It handles special cases such as NaN, positive and negative infinity, and zero, and throws an error if the base is not between 2 and 36. For bases other than 10, it uses a specific conversion method; for base 10, it formats the number using a standard decimal representation.

Q: What is returned when the d parameter is equal to 0.0? 

A: When the d parameter is equal to 0.0, the method returns the string "0".

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are d (the double value to be converted) and base (the integer specifying the numeral base for conversion).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
**Inputs:**  
- **d**: This is a parameter of type `double`. It can take any double-precision floating-point value, including special values such as NaN (Not a Number), positive infinity, negative infinity, zero (0.0), negative zero (-0.0), and any finite real number (positive or negative).
- **base**: This is a parameter of type `int` (integer). Its possible values are all integers, but the method only accepts values from 2 to 36 (inclusive). If a value outside this range is provided, the method throws a runtime error.

**Output:**  
- The return type is `String`. The possible output values are:
  - "NaN" if d is not a number.
  - "Infinity" if d is positive infinity.
  - "-Infinity" if d is negative infinity.
  - "0" if d is 0.0.
  - For other values of d, a string representation of the number in the specified base (from 2 to 36), using either a custom conversion method for non-decimal bases or standard decimal formatting for base 10. The exact string will depend on the value of d and the base.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are:

- For d (the double value):  
  - NaN (Not a Number)
  - Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
  - Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
  - 0.0 (zero)
  - Any other finite double value (positive or negative)

- For base (the integer specifying the numeral base):  
  - Any integer from 2 to 36 (inclusive) is valid.
  - Values less than 2 or greater than 36 are invalid and will cause the method to throw a runtime error.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

{
    "Conditions": {
        "d": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        },

    "Conclusions": {

        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [

        {
            "d": "d == 0.0",
            "base": "-",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return \"0\";"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "(base < 2) || (base > 36)",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "throw Context.reportRuntimeError1(\"msg.bad.radix\", Integer.toString(base));"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base != 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return DToA.JS_dtobasestr(base, d);"
        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base == 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: The table is complete. For every possible combination of inputs for d and base, there is a corresponding rule that applies:

- If d is NaN, positive infinity, negative infinity, or zero, the first four rules apply regardless of base.
- If none of those special cases apply, the next rule checks if base is outside the valid range (less than 2 or greater than 36).
- If base is valid and not 10, the next rule applies.
- If base is exactly 10, the final rule applies.

There is no input combination for which none of the rules would be applicable.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What is returned when the base parameter is smaller than 2? 

A: When the base parameter is smaller than 2, the method throws an exception using Context.reportRuntimeError1("msg.bad.radix", Integer.toString(base));.
