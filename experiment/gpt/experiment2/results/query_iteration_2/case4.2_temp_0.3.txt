Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

A: This code decides how to convert a given double-precision floating-point number (d) into its string representation in a specified numerical base (base). It handles special cases such as NaN, positive and negative infinity, and zero, and throws an error if the base is not between 2 and 36. For bases other than 10, it uses a specific method to convert the number; for base 10, it formats the number using another method.

Q: What is returned when the d parameter is equal to 0.0? 

A: When the d parameter is equal to 0.0, the method returns the string "0".

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are d (the double value to be converted) and base (the numerical base for the string representation).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
- Input:  
  - d: This is a double (floating-point number). Its possible values include any valid Java double value, such as regular numbers (positive or negative), 0.0, Double.NaN (not-a-number), Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, and Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
  - base: This is an int (integer). Its possible values are any integer, but the method only accepts values from 2 to 36 inclusive; otherwise, it throws an error.

- Output:  
  - The return value is a String. Its possible values include:
    - "NaN" if d is not-a-number,
    - "Infinity" if d is positive infinity,
    - "-Infinity" if d is negative infinity,
    - "0" if d is zero,
    - Otherwise, a string representation of the number d in the specified base (using either DToA.JS_dtobasestr for bases other than 10, or DToA.JS_dtostr for base 10).

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are:

- For d (the double value):  
  - NaN (not-a-number)
  - Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
  - Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
  - 0.0
  - Any other finite double value (positive or negative)

- For base (the integer base):  
  - Any integer less than 2 (invalid, causes an error)
  - Any integer greater than 36 (invalid, causes an error)
  - Any integer from 2 to 36 inclusive (valid, used for conversion)
  - Specifically, base = 10 (triggers decimal conversion logic)
  - Any valid base not equal to 10 (triggers non-decimal conversion logic)

Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

        },
        {
            "d": "-",
            "base": "base == 10",
            "numberToString(double d, int base)": "DToA.JS_dtostr(result, DToA.DTOSTR_STANDARD, 0, d); return result.toString();"
        }
    ]
}

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: The table is incomplete. For example, if d is not NaN, not positive or negative infinity, not 0.0, and base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), but base == 10, then both the last two rules ("base != 10" and "base == 10") could apply, but only if d does not match any of the earlier conditions. However, the table as written does not clearly specify the mutual exclusivity of these conditions, and the "-" value for d in the last three rules means that if d matches any of the earlier cases, those rules might also be considered applicable. 

More importantly, if d is, for example, 5.5 and base is 8, then none of the first four rules for d apply, the fifth rule for base does not apply (since base is valid), and the sixth rule applies (since base != 10). But if base is 10, then the seventh rule applies. So, technically, all input combinations are covered, but the use of "-" in the conditions makes it ambiguous, and the rules are not mutually exclusive or prioritized. 

Therefore, while every input seems to have a matching rule, the table's structure with "-" values and overlapping conditions can lead to ambiguity about which rule should be applied first. A more precise table would explicitly order the rules or clarify that earlier rules take precedence over later ones.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What is returned when the base parameter is smaller than 2? 

A: When the base parameter is smaller than 2, the method throws an exception with the statement: throw Context.reportRuntimeError1("msg.bad.radix", Integer.toString(base));
