Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

""" 

A: This code decides how to update and manage the progress of a task identified by "id" within a tree-based UI component. It determines whether to create a new progress node, insert it into the tree, update its progress value, remove it when complete (when progress equals 1), and ensure the UI reflects these changes.

Q: What happens when the p parameter is equal to 1? 

A: When the p parameter is equal to 1, the code removes the corresponding ProgressNode from both the progressNodes map and the filesNode in the tree, indicating that the task is complete.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are id (the identifier for the task or channel), p (the progress value), pn (the ProgressNode associated with the id), progressNodes (the map storing ProgressNodes), filesNodeInTree (a boolean indicating if the filesNode is in the tree), and filesNode (the parent node in the tree structure).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
Inputs:
- id: This is a String representing the unique identifier for a task or channel. Its possible values are any valid Java String.
- p: This is a double representing the progress value of the task. Its possible values are any double between 0 and 1, where 0 means no progress and 1 means the task is complete.

Outputs:
- The function does not return a value (void), but it produces side effects:
    - It updates the progressNodes map, which maps String ids to ProgressNode objects.
    - It modifies the tree structure by inserting or removing nodes (ProgressNode and filesNode) in the model/tree.
    - It updates the UI by expanding paths and repainting the dataTree component.
    - ProgressNode: This is an object (likely a custom class) representing the progress state of a task; its internal state (such as progress value) is updated.
    - filesNodeInTree: This is a boolean flag indicating whether filesNode is present in the tree; it can be true or false.
    - filesNode: This is a tree node object (probably a DefaultMutableTreeNode or similar) that acts as a parent for ProgressNodes in the tree. Its value is an object reference and its children can change dynamically.

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variable p are between 0 and 1, inclusive. Specifically, p = 0 represents no progress, values between 0 and 1 represent partial progress, and p = 1 represents completion of the task, which triggers removal of the corresponding ProgressNode from the data structures.

Q: 
Consider the following examples (6 examples; some contain decisions (i.e., at a function level) that can be modeled, and some do not):

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: This table is incomplete. The rules in the table do not cover all possible combinations of the input variables pn, filesNodeInTree, and p for every decision point; rather, each rule corresponds to a specific action triggered by a particular condition, not a full mapping from all possible input combinations to conclusions. For example, if pn is not null, filesNodeInTree is true, ins is false, and p is not 1, there is no single rule that describes what happens for this combination as a whole—only individual actions that may or may not be executed. Thus, there are input combinations (such as pn != null, filesNodeInTree == true, p != 1, ins == false) for which no single rule in the table applies, demonstrating incompleteness.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What does the channelsProgress method return? 

A: According to the table, the channelsProgress method does not return any value; its return type is void.
