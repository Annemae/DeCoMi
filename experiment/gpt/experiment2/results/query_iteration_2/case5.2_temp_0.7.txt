Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:" followed by your answer. Only provide an answer to the question which has not been answered yet. Respond using only regular sentences, unless specified otherwise. Below is a part of Java source code, between quotation marks. What does this code decide?

""" 

A: This code decides how to convert a substring of a given string (starting at a specified position) into a numeric value, interpreting it as an integer in the given radix (base). It handles bases from 2 up to 36, processes both uppercase and lowercase letters for digits beyond '9', and applies special logic for very large numbers (at or above 2^53) to maintain precision, particularly for bases 10, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. If the substring does not represent a valid number in the specified radix, it returns NaN.

Q: What is returned when the start parameter is equal to the end local variable? 

A: When the start parameter is equal to the end local variable, it means that no valid digits were found in the substring for the specified radix. In this case, the function returns NaN.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision? 

A: The variables that influence this decision are s (the input string), start (the starting index for parsing), radix (the numeric base), len (the length of the string), and end (the index up to which valid digits are found). Specifically, the comparison between start and end determines whether any valid digits were parsed; if they are equal, no valid digits were found.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values. 

A:  
Here is an overview of each input and output, including their data types and possible values:

**Inputs:**

1. **s (String)**  
   - Data type: String  
   - Possible values: Any valid Java String. Typically represents the string to be parsed into a number. Can include digits ('0'-'9'), letters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z'), and other characters.

2. **start (int)**  
   - Data type: int (primitive integer)  
   - Possible values: Any valid integer in the range [0, s.length()]. Indicates the index in s from which parsing should begin.

3. **radix (int)**  
   - Data type: int (primitive integer)  
   - Possible values: Usually between 2 and 36 inclusive. Specifies the numeric base for parsing (e.g., 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal).

**Output:**

1. **Return value (double)**  
   - Data type: double (primitive floating-point number)  
   - Possible values:  
     - Any non-negative numeric value representable as a double, depending on the substring and radix.
     - NaN (Not-a-Number) if no valid digits are found or parsing fails (e.g., invalid format for the given radix).
     - May be positive infinity for extremely large numbers beyond double’s representable range.  

In summary:  
- Input: `String` (any), `int` (start index, usually 0 to string length), `int` (radix, typically 2-36)  
- Output: `double` (parsed value, or NaN if parsing fails)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables? 

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are:

- **start:** Should be a non-negative integer, typically in the range [0, s.length()]. It determines where parsing begins. If start >= s.length(), no characters will be parsed.
- **radix:** Must be at least 2 and at most 36 for parsing to make sense, as these are the typical limits for numeric bases (2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal, up to 36 for alphanumeric).
- **end:** Initialized to start, and incremented as long as valid digits in the specified radix are found. Its final value indicates the position after the last valid digit.
- **len:** Equals s.length(), indicating the length of the input string. Used to limit the parsing loop.
- **sum:** Accumulates the resulting number, starting at 0.0 and increasing as digits are processed. Can become very large if the parsed number is large.
- **Other local numerics (exactBitsLimit, factor, bitShiftInChar, digit, etc.):** These are used in special handling for large numbers, particularly when sum exceeds 2^53 (9007199254740992.0), but their relevant values depend on the size and content of the input.

Most importantly for the main decision:
- **start and end**: If start == end, then no valid digits were found.
- **radix**: Must be within [2, 36] for standard use; the code adjusts logic based on its value.
- **sum**: If it grows beyond 2^53, special handling is triggered for certain radices.

In summary, the relevant values are:
- start: 0 <= start <= s.length()
- radix: 2 <= radix <= 36
- end: start <= end <= s.length()
- sum: 0.0 up to very large double values (potentially triggering special logic when sum >= 2^53)

Q:

Could you generate a DMN decision table in JSON format for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q"?

Please follow these rules when extracting the decision table:

1) For the conditions of each decision, include only the variables (i.e., function parameters and/or local variables) that are directly part of a decision expression (e.g., an `if` statement) within that function that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement).
2) Only extract the specific line of code on which the decision is made (e.g., an exit statement). Do not include the entire function body surrounding it.
3) Do not include both a variable and its opposite (e.g., not x && !x, or x > 0 && x <= 0) as separate values within the same decision rule condition. One is sufficient, as the opposite case should be covered by a separate rule. This rule does not apply when the condition involves different variables.
4) If multiple variables together form a single decision expression that directly influences a decision (e.g., an exit statement), they should be grouped as one condition in the JSON representation.
5) Use only the base variable names for conditions, conclusions, and decision rules, exactly as they appear in the source code. Do not rename, alter, invent, or include field/property accesses (e.g., user.name) with variable names. Even if a property is accessed in the code, include only the top-level variable (e.g., use user, not user.name).
6) Extract the conditions, conclusions, and decision rules exactly as they are defined in the source code. Do not interpret, transform, or modify them. For example, if a variable is used as a boolean expression (e.g., number == 2), do not treat it as a numeric value (2).

If a decision table is present in the code, provide a complete and valid structured JSON object with conditions, conclusions, and decision rules for this part of Java source code.  
If no decision table can be constructed, return an empty JSON object.  
Do not write anything else.

Create a decision table for the part of Java source code provided in the first question that starts with "Q".
 

```json
{
    "Conditions": {
        "start, end": {
            "Type": "boolean"
        }
    },
    "Conclusions": {
        "stringToNumber(String s, int start, int radix)": {
            "Type": "string"
        }
    },
    "DecisionRules": [
        {
            "start, end": "start == end",
            "stringToNumber(String s, int start, int radix)": "return NaN;"
        }
    ]
}
```

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable? 

A: No, this table is not complete. The table only covers the case where start == end, i.e., when no valid digits are found and the function returns NaN. It does not cover the case when start != end, i.e., when valid digits are found and the function continues to decide what value to return (which could be sum, Double.valueOf(...), or a specially processed value for large numbers in certain radices). For example, if start < end, the only rule in the table does not apply, so no rule would be applicable for inputs where valid digits are found in the substring.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question. What happens when a NumberFormatException is thrown? 

A: According to the table, there is no rule that addresses what happens when a NumberFormatException is thrown. The table only covers the case when start == end and returns NaN, but it does not include any decision rule for when a NumberFormatException occurs. Therefore, the table does not specify what happens in this situation.
